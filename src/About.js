                    Hi there, my name is Christopher Schnell, but I also go by my middle name Tyler. I created this website to start showcasing some of my side projects and ideas related to programming. <br></br>
                    Currently the only thing I have added is a simple sort visualizer. It is optimized for both desktop & mobile, but only has bare minimum functionality so I plan to add more features to it.<br></br>
                    <br></br>Recently my programming interests have been related (but not limited) to audio & sound, blockchain development, & web development. <br></br>
                    <br></br>In terms of what's next to be added here, 1  thing I have started working on is a fitness app that can track your workouts and display the data in useful ways.<br></br>
                    <br></br>If you would like to get in contact, please feel free to reach me at tylerschnell123@gmail.com

                    <br></br><br></br>Have a good one!
